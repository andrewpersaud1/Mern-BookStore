# Mern Stack Project
## Description

A project I made that Incorporates MongoDB, Express, React, and Node to make a Bookstore come to life. I first started by:

- Creating a cluster at Mongodb.com and connecting it with an HTTP Route (which gave me access to my cluster)
- Creating a base model with Mongoose so that I can have fields like title, author, and year published
- Saving a book with Mongoose
  
After that, I decided to establish a different amount of routes that would allow me to create a book, view a book, save a book, query a list of books, update a book, and replace a book. 
I then incorporated CORS with Node.js and Express, which then led to the front-end portion of the project. 

I used Vite for React and Tailwind CSS for styling. After styling the front end, I was left with a UI that allowed me to view every book in the backend that I created and I had three options:
- edit
- create
- delete

Overall this project was great for understanding how front-end and back-end functionality works, and it was my first time using Mern.
